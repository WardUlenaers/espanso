# My personal espanso config

[Espanso](https://espanso.org/) is an open-source text expander that operates across multiple platforms. It allows you to create custom text shortcuts for snippets, commands, and forms, which can be based on complex triggers.
This repository holds my personal configuration and matches (the actual text replacement snippets) for Espanso.
I kept things very simple but maybe it will be useful to someone else.
